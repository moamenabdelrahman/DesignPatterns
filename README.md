# Design Patterns
- This repository contains micro-projects I implement while learning design patterns.
- I learn the theory of each pattern from [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
- After each couple of patterns I learn, I ask [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) to imagine a business scenario for each pattern, without telling me explicitly which pattern to use.
